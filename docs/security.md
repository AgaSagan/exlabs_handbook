# Security Practices
* Set up Lastpass as your password manager, use it to generate strong passwords for any new accounts
* Never reuse passwords across company or personal services.
* Avoid using your personal accounts such as email for sharing company data.
* Do not share credentials via email, JIRA issues, etc. Always use Lastpass. This includes logins, credit card details, API keys.
* Use 2FA where possible, especially for your Google, Github, Slack. Accounts without 2FA in some of our services might be blocked until resolved.
* Only sign of to various services from trusted devices and networks. Public computers and Public WIFIs are not trustworthy.
