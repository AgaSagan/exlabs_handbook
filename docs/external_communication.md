# External Communication
It's important to emphasize that relationship with our clients is a cornerstone of our business at Exlabs. We strive as a company to position ourselves as a partner to our customers and it require presenting high standards across all touchpoints with the clients.
This guide covers basic communication rules with external parties, such as clients, partners or suppliers.


# Email Communication
* NEVER ignore a piece of communication, even if you believe you've received it by mistake and/or it's irrelevant to you (including cc)
* Respond as soon as possible to an email from a client, not later than the end of the following business day. Please remember to use 'Reply to all'.
* If an email is forwarded to you, it's forwarded for a reason. Please respond to either the person forwarding the email, or the end involved party (e.g. client). If in doubt, contact Peter Kolka. Please respond as soon as possible, but no later than the end of the following business day.
Forwarded emails generally are FYI (for your information) ie. something that is, or may soon become useful or relevant, and you will be expected to be aware of it when it becomes relevant.
* Regardless of your current responsibilities (e.g. you're no longer working on a project in question) or if an email, message or notification was addressed to more than one person or you were cc'd, you are expected to either respond to that communication directly, or if in doubt, ask PK if your input is required. Response times should be as above.
* In order for the above to work, refrain from cc'd people on emails, unless it's really essential.
* ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS USE YOUR COMPANY EMAIL ADDRESS, IDEALLY THE .CO.UK ONE.
SET UP YOUR GMAIL TO AUTOMATICALLY SEND/REPLY TO EMAILS FROM THE .CO.UK DOMAIN. You can do so by going to Settings in Gmail and then select 'Accounts'. Change the reply address to initial.surname@exlabs.co.uk and then edit the account name info to 'Name Surname - Exlabs Software'. Make sure the 'reply' address is also set to .co.uk email by default.
# Email Writing Guidelines
1. Greeting - 'Dear' or 'Hi', depending on the circumstances. Most of the time it should be 'Hi', unless the relationship is very official
2. Addressee - Apart from the greeting, ALWAYS use either the name of the person you're writing too. Alternatively, if you're addressing multiple people, use 'All' instead. E.g. Hi John or Hi All, never just Hi.
3. It's normally expected to start a new thread (conversation) with a kind gesture, such as 'I hope everything is fine on your side' or 'I hope you are ok'. This is not compulsory however. Please note this does not apply if you exchange emails with someone frequently i.e. you wouldn't write it twice on the same day, to the same person.
4. If the above kind gesture isn't applicable, start the email with 'I am writing to...' (e.g. let you know, ask about, remind you, find out etc) rather than just start talking about the purpose. Also, if yu are replying to someone's email, it's safe to say 'Thanks for your email'.
5. Try to structure your email where different topics/parts of the conversation are separated by using different paragraphs.
6. Try to be as descriptive as you can, NEVER assume anything is obvious, ALWAYS state all relevant fact. Assume the client is completely not technical with no knowledge of the production process.
7. Never just ask for feedback, always guide the client with your thinking process, why you've taken such decisions etc
8. Finish the email with a call to action, be clear what you expect them to do.
9 Sign your email with either 'Thanks' or 'Best regards', depending on how official the relationship is. Don't use your name as it will be included in the signature.
10. All of the above are to be used with a pinch of salt as there are no strict rules to writing an email and they do require some common sense.

# Video Communication
* Use Google Calendar to schedule a call and remember to include a link to a call to RSVP. We don't have a standard video-chat tool, although we prefer Zoom and Google Hangouts.
* Make sure you are on time on the call (good practice is to join a minute before the start).
* When possible turn on your camera when talking to a client, especially at the beginning of a call, to establish better relationship.
# Meetings
From time to time face-to-face meetings are organised.
During a meeting with a client we use English only, unless agreed otherwise. Speaking in other languages (ie. Polish) is not  welcomed in presence of a client.
# Presentations
We do a lot of client presentations sharing work progress etc.
TODO
Also please make sure you don't use and display any offensive or stupid dummy data in you presentations.
# Code of Conduct
At Exlabs we work with clients from various countries are working with clients and partners from around the world and we want to promote and embrace diversity.
Communicating with
Jokes about race, religion, sex orientation, gender, origin, disability are not acceptable.

Conflicts are inherent part of communication.
* Don't use offensive language, even when it's used by the other side
* In situation of conflict focus on constructive arguments and avoid emotional reactions
