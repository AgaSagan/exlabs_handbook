# Exlabs Handbook
This Exlabs handbook is a repository of how we run company activities. We encourage everyone to participate in creating this handbook by adding suggestions and clarifications using pull requests. Please use issues to ask questions.

This is where we try to share how we work here, what our culture is and who we actually are as a company. It's also a place where you we hope you will find the answers to questions like when's your next Performance Review, whether it's ok to take a holiday if it's your first month of work.
