# Security Practices
* Set up Lastpass as your password manager, use it to generate strong passwords for any new accounts
* Never reuse passwords across company or personal services. Use strong passwords (Lastpass really help with that a lot!) and change passwords every 3 months.
* Avoid using your personal accounts such as email for sharing company data.
* Do not share credentials via email, JIRA issues, etc. Always use Lastpass. This includes logins, credit card details, API keys.
* Use 2FA where possible, especially for your Google, Github, Slack. Accounts without 2FA in some of our services might be blocked until resolved.
* Only sign of to various services from trusted devices and networks. Public computers and Public WIFIs are not trustworthy. Try to limit number of devices used for company activities. Avoid using mobile when not necessary.

Set up with CTO suitable timeframe for login to github
Krzysztof sends you the password via lastpass
Login to github and asks CTO for 2FA token
