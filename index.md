# Exlabs Handbook
This Exlabs Handbook is a repository of how we run company activities. We encourage everyone to participate in creating this handbook by adding suggestions and clarifications. Use pull requests in this repo https://github.com/exlabs/exlabs_handbook
. Please use issues to ask questions.

This is where we try to share how we work here, what our culture is and who we actually are as a company. It's also a place where you we hope you will find the answers to questions like when's your next Performance Review, whether it's ok to take a holiday if it's your first month of work.

Everything in this Handbook draft and subject to change so don't be afraid to add your suggestions.
