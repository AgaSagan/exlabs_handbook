# Time Off Policy

Your time off allowance is defined in your contract and it's at least 20 days a year (proportionally to the time you are with us in given calendar year).
For people working with us on B2B contracts, we provide up to 30 consecutive paid days of Sick Leave in case of hospitalisation or any other medical treatment.

##Guide to taking time off
  * We have "no ask, must tell policy" for taking time off. This means you don't need to ask permission to take time off, but make sure you inform your manager.
  * While you don't need to ask for permission, it's always good to discuss itwith your manager or peers to avoid misunderstandings or to leave your team without without any support (especially important during Festive Season)
  * Report your time of using our internal tool at http://timeoff.exlabs.co.uk
