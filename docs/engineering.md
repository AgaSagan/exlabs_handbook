#Engineering
Engineering is a core of what we do here at Exlabs.
We always learn new things about our craft and strive for excelence. In heart of our philosophy about software development is Pragmatic Engineering. We don't believe day to day project management methodology or new shiny technology is what makes or breaks software project.
We believe in clarity from the start, directional milestones and transparency on an ongoing basis.
This Trello board might be useful for explaing our engineering workflows (private) [Development guideline](https://trello.com/b/a5ryxT5Z/development-guideline) until this guide is finished.
